RemitWise – Global Payments Web Experience

Role: UI/UX Designer
Platform: Web
Focus: Cross-border payments · Fintech · Scalability

Project Overview

I designed the RemitWise landing page and dashboard experience to communicate trust, speed, and global accessibility. The goal was to simplify complex cross-border payments into an intuitive, modern interface that feels secure and easy to use for everyday users.

Problem

Many remittance platforms overwhelm users with dense information and unclear flows, which reduces trust and slows adoption—especially for first-time users sending money internationally.

Design Goals

Present global payments as simple and accessible

Build trust through visual hierarchy and clarity

Highlight key product capabilities without clutter

Create a scalable design system for future features

Design Approach

I used a dark, warm gradient theme paired with bold typography to establish a premium fintech feel. The hero section focuses on a clear value proposition—Global Payments Without Borders—supported by strong CTAs to guide users into action.

Key product metrics were surfaced early to reinforce credibility and adoption at scale.

Key UI Decisions

Hero section: Clear headline, concise supporting copy, and strong primary/secondary CTAs

Feature cards: Modular layout to communicate ecosystem capabilities at a glance

Quick Actions: Task-based design to reduce time-to-action for frequent user flows

Visual consistency: Rounded cards, soft shadows, and iconography for a cohesive experience

Scalability: Components designed to be reusable across dashboard and future pages

Core Features Highlighted
